Organising html content into seperate pages ad where I want them to be Going to start exploring the use of external CSS file and designing the website. Have decided that after I learn how to link the css file with the html content, I will be using templates online to speed up the process of building the website, Due to simplicity and time consumation. The main goal was to learn DNS, and pointing domain names whilst learning basic web developmenet skills and how it is built from scratch to understand the fundamentals. I believe there is no point in continuing, to code in html and css.

Did not do anything the previous day was lazy. Linked the CSS file played around with the content a little. Too nit picky and time consuming. Moving on to a template website, BUT I now understand the mechanics of a website.
