# 4/01/2022 - Decided to start building a 
# Website that will contain all my projects and resumes. 

# 5/01/2022 - Started going through w3schools.com and throwing random things onto 
# my website. Started hositng it on netlify. Got a free domain from Namecheap.

# 6/01/2022 - Organising html content into seperate pages ad where I want them to be
# Going to start exploring the use of external CSS file and designing the website. 
# Have decided that after I learn how to link the css file with the html content,
# I will be using templates online to speed up the process of building the website,
# Due to simplicity and time consumation. The main goal was to learn DNS, and pointing
# domain names whilst learning basic web developmenet skills and how it is built from 
# scratch to understand the fundamentals. I believe there is no point in continuing,
# to code in html and css.

# 07/01/2022 - Contiuing work from previous day.

# 08/01/2022 - Did not do anything the previous day was lazy. Linked the CSS file
# played around with the content a little. Too nit picky and time consuming. 
# Moving on to a template website, BUT I now understand the mechanics of a website.
