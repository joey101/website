Helloooooooo and "wElCoMe tO mY yOuTuBe cHaNnEl",

## Intro: 
Sooooo, New project, I was so sick and tired of all the parking tickets get, so I 
wanted to create an object detection program witha  raspberry pi that would alert me
every time a parking officer comes passed.

BUT I have no clue anything about object detection or machine learning or of the sort,
so I am going to start learning from scratch, I will be using libraries to assist, 
but also will be blogging the different types of algorithms and how an object is actually detected,
within an image.

## Looking into:
- What is single point resampling?
- What is weighted average re-sampling?
