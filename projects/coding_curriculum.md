## Welcome to another page

## About:
During 10th grade as part of the IB curriculum we had to do projects on any topic that addressed issues around the world.

## Goal:
The goal for my personal project was to have kids that have no or limited knowledge of coding to fully code a robot to complete any commands or problems posed to them. 

## How I did it:

Learnt about other systems like an Arduino and settled on a company called makeblock. Taught the students scratch and block code.
