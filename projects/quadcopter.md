# Quadcopter


## Goal:

The goal of this project is to make a quadcopter, using a microcontroller. The 
micro-controller that was utilised is an arduino nano. The goal was to make my own flight controller using a gyroscope and accelerometer, the MPU-6050 to be exact.

## What I learnt:

This project taught me to read data sheets and convert a data sheet into code, I learnt and understood the communication method of I2C and the relationship between master and slave communication. 

## Code:

Still in Progress.
