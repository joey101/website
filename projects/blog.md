## What is this Progress Bar?

This progress bar, is going to be a 10 week road map to getting an intership, filled with minor projects coupled with an ultimate big project.
It will be a clickable entity that will allow you to go to my blogs, and LinkedIn profile post about the project.

At the current moment I am just playing around and adding a random button to just learn hwo to actually have the progress bar on my page,
and to redirect to this written blog.
